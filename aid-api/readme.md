## SECTIONS

Sections are a generic container for information related to a given aid item.  This can include sort type sections or copy text sections.  Section types are used to differentiate between these 2 types of sections.  Sections are further identified into topics.  Each section element has a topic that identifies the "bucket" of which this sections item is a member.

### Topics

Topics represent the logical boundaries or a "bucket" for the section element.  Topics allow section elements to create an association between aid items and "buckets" such as gender, heratige, finacial need, ect.  There are 22 unique topcis for sort type section elements.
